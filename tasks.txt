-Investigate if gimme_ips can work under the ips/gimme_ips
--Doesn't look like it since it automatically takes anything after ips/ and 
  searches it using the id i.e. id=gimme_ips.  Follow up with Jared/rick on this
  one
-gimme_ips
--Add support to how many IP's can be requested in gimme_ips
--When looking up free ip's, do a ping/rdp/ssh test to confirm they are available
-Create networks model
--Create one-to-many relationship of networks to ip's
--Automatically create ip's based on networks added
--Support for network in gimme_ips
--Add validation
-Testing
--Create script that will populate with networks/ip's for testing
-Update IP's
--Look into updating IP's in batches
--Implement actions to set attributes for a whole subnet of IP's with one command
  i.e. automatically set all IP's for a network as PCI in-scope
--Validation
-Setup authentication for API
-Play around with gui/bootstrap templates
